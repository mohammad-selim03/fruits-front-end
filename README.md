Unzip or clone the specific file like "client" in terminal type "npm install". After that type "npm run dev" to start the project locally on pc. Although there's a bakend part here. I hoisted the backend code on render. So, if you run client side on pc it's automatically got data from backend code that hoisted on internet. There's no need to run backend locally.
